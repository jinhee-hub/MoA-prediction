# MoA-prediction
MoA prediction for the drug discovery

For the drug discovery, scientists labeled some features for protein data, and they called it Mechanism-of-action(MoA).
It includes NFKB_inhibitor, Dopamine_receptor_antagonist, Calcium_cahnnel_blocker, ...

this project aims for analyzing patterns in genomic database with known MoAs.

We used RBF kernel Regression, MultiLayer Perceptron, and TabNet for MoA prediction.
